# Android-ATC-12-Labs

Projects from Android (Advanced Training Consultants) book:
[Android Application Development v12](https://androidatc.com/public/_signin.php)

This book is required as "ramp" material for the CSUS's CSC 196P:
Cloud and Mobile Applications (iOS, Android, and IoT)

A subpar independent, not affiliated with Google, accreditation company that
publishes a PDF "e-book". This PDF is accessible solely through their login portal
and features a rudimentary web PDF viewer. The e-book exhibits numerous spelling,
grammar, and code sample inconsistencies and errors.

Equally important, the PDF viewer lacks any distinguishing features or
enhancements (like the ability to take notes on the page or send to Kindle) to
justify the premium $14 price tag associated with accessing it through a
dedicated login portal.

3.5 stars out of 10 stars...

Sometimes your best isn't good enough try harder with v13.
